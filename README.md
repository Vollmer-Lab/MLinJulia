## ML/AI in Julia


The challenge of bringing projects from research to real-world impact is spinning out of control. Ideas need to reach the cloud and clusters for large-scale data for real-time analysis and be built on by other industrial/ academic projects. Ad-hoc solutions by fragmented research groups using different languages create sprawling codebases and myriad tools that impair collaboration and innovation. Meanwhile, the well-oiled machines of Google (Deepmind), Facebook and others loom large over academic initiatives.
 

The Julia language offers a compelling solution: A single system (no need for specialist wrapping C++ code - Julia code runs on GPUs! - single code base for end-user) that can meet all of these demands at once, cutting down the innovation cycle by months or years. Julia can easily tie in to pre-existing solution in any language. The general user can implement non-standard variations of common algorithms without the need to write and understand low-level code - Moreover,  Additional arguments for Julia are performance and parallel computing support  in contrast to dominant languages R and Python. 

This course will introduce the language and demonstrates Machine Learning and Probabilistic Programming in that context.

Please install Julia as explained at  https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/ but *Version 1.7*.
